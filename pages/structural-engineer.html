      <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
        I began my career as a Structural Engineer in 2019, designing residential and medium-rise structures for municipalities in Nepal. The workflow was quite predictable: I’d start my structural models in ETABS, complete the designs, then move on to reinforcement detailing in AutoCAD. Finally, I’d prepare a standard report to wrap up the project on my end.
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
        Once my work was done, the project would be submitted to the municipality for approval. Surprisingly, the designs themselves were rarely, if ever, checked. Once that was done, approvals were typically granted by the end of the day.
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
        My routine soon became monotonous, confined to my desk and laptop. I spent most of my time designing structures, filling in Excel spreadsheets for reports, and adding screenshots to make those reports look presentable. It felt far removed from the dynamic and creative career I had envisioned when I chose engineering.
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
        I didn’t study engineering to follow a formulaic routine, but I wasn’t ready to challenge the system either. Instead, I turned to something I later discovered I was not only good at but genuinely passionate about: <strong>Automation</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
        In the final months of my first job, I started creating Excel spreadsheets to streamline my calculations. Over time, these spreadsheets became so advanced that, after completing my ETABS models, I could simply paste the summary table into Excel, and it would generate most of the report for me. What used to take an entire workday could now be done in just 1–2 hours, leaving me with plenty of free time (which I often spent watching YouTube).

    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
        It’s incredible how my journey with Excel sparked my transition into software development. Curious to know how? <a href="#">Read more here.</a>
